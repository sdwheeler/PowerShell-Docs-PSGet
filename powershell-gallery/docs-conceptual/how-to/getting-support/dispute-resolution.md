# Dispute resolution

This document is a recommended dispute resolution process for community members to help resolve
disputes with other PowerShell Gallery publishers.

## Process

1. Contact the owners of the package you have the dispute with using the **Contact Owners** link on
   the package details page. Explain your issue in a kind and direct manner.
1. Send a copy of your message to [cgadmin@microsoft.com][01] so that PowerShell Gallery
   Administrators are aware of your dispute.
1. Wait a maximum of 30 days. If you don't have resolution, notify [cgadmin@microsoft.com][01]
   again.

The PowerShell Gallery support team will work with both parties to help resolve the dispute.

## Prohibited Use

The following things aren't allowed on the public PowerShell Gallery and will be immediately removed
without discussion. Package owners are notified if their package is removed.

- Malware, adware, or any kind of spyware
- Packages that are designed to harm the user systems
- Copyright infringement or license violation
- Illegal content
- "Squatting" on package names that you plan to use but aren't actually using. This also includes
  publishing packages that have zero productive content. Either publish code and get going or
  concede the name to someone who actually has a product to ship.
- Attempting to make the gallery do something that it isn't explicitly designed to do.

If you find a package that's in violation of any of these items, select the **Report Abuse** link on
the package details page and submit a report.

**This policy is subject to change at the discretion of the PowerShell Gallery.**
